# HaikuCli

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

```bash
mix escript.install github nwjlyons/haiku
```

Add `~/.mix/escripts` to your `PATH`.


This is an example of what happens when you run `haiku`:

```
$ haiku
autumn-field
```

Inspired from this gist https://gist.github.com/afriggeri/1266756

I created a previous version of this using Go https://github.com/nwjlyons/haiku-go
